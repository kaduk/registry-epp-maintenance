Registry Maintenance Notifications for the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)
=================

## Goal
The goal is to create a new EPP extension for Registry Maintenance Notifications and submit it as an IETF Internet-Draft to develop an [RFC].

## The Current Status
This idea was raised in the ICANN Registrar Stakeholder Group ([RrSG]) Technical and Operational ([TechOps]) Subcommittee and further discussed in the [CPH TechOps] Group. Based on those discussions the document was submitted to the IETF REGEXT Working Group and adopted. This draft is on Standards Track to become an RFC.

## Validation of IETF draft
You may validate the [draft] document with https://tools.ietf.org/tools/idnits/.
