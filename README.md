Registry Maintenance Notifications for the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)
=================

## Goal
The goal is to create a new EPP extension for Registry Maintenance Notifications and submit it as an IETF Internet-Draft to develop an [RFC].

## Status
This idea was raised by the ICANN Registrar Stakeholder Group ([RrSG]) Technical and Operational ([TechOps]) Subcommittee and further discussed in the [CPH TechOps] Group. Based on those discussions, the document was submitted to the IETF REGEXT Working Group and adopted. Therefore, this draft is on Standards Track to become an RFC.

After refining the draft, it passed the Working Group Last Call, and the Chair submitted it to [IESG] for publishing. It then passed the Area Director's evaluation and is in Last Call at IESG. Following the draft will be moved forward to the RFC Editor Queue to be published as an RFC.
